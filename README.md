# Project Name: STAT184 GitHub Assignment Template

## Introduction
This repository is a template developed for the STAT184 assignment, mainly used to organize code files and data files. It helps students learn how to use GitHub for version control and project management.

## Implementation
In the process of completing the assignment, I wrote a Quarto Markdown file (hello.qmd) to record the code and analysis. In addition, I also added a metadata file (directory_metadata.txt) to explain the repository structure in detail. These files provide support for the structuring and traceability of the project.

## Summary of Results
The outcome of the assignment is a clearly structured repository with code and data folders. The directory metadata within the repository provides a clear description, which helps to quickly get started and reuse in similar projects in the future.
